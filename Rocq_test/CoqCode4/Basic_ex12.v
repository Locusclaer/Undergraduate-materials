(* 实践作业12：简单布尔类型的定义和证明。nandb,andb3 *)
(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Booleans *)

(** Following the pattern of the days of the week above, we can
    define the standard type [bool] of booleans, with members [true]
    and [false]. *)

Inductive bool : Type :=
  | true
  | false.

(** Functions over booleans can be defined in the same way as
    above: *)

Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => b2
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => true
  | false => b2
  end.

(** We can also introduce more familiar and readable infix
    syntax for the boolean operations we have just defined. The
    [Notation] command defines a new symbolic notation for an existing
    definition. *)

Notation "x && y" := (andb x y).
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y).

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (nandb)

    The [Admitted] command can be used as a placeholder for an
    incomplete proof.  We use it in exercises to indicate the parts
    that we're leaving for you -- i.e., your job is to replace
    [Admitted]s with real proofs.

    Remove "[Admitted.]" and complete the definition of the following
    function; then make sure that the [Example] assertions below can
    each be verified by Coq.  (I.e., fill in each proof, following the
    model of the [orb] tests above, and make sure Coq accepts it.) The
    function should return [true] if either or both of its inputs are
    [false].

    Hint: if [simpl] will not simplify the goal in your proof, it's
    probably because you defined [nandb] without using a [match]
    expression. Try a different definition of [nandb], or just
    skip over [simpl] and go directly to [reflexivity]. We'll
    explain this phenomenon later in the chapter. *)

Definition nandb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => negb b2
  | false => true
  end.

Example test_nandb1:               (nandb true false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_nandb2:               (nandb false false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_nandb3:               (nandb false true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_nandb4:               (nandb true true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (andb3)

    Do the same for the [andb3] function below. This function should
    return [true] when all of its inputs are [true], and [false]
    otherwise. *)

Definition andb3 (b1:bool) (b2:bool) (b3:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => match b2 with
            | true => b3
            | false => false
            end
  | false => false
  end.

Example test_andb31:                 (andb3 true true true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb32:                 (andb3 false true true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb33:                 (andb3 true false true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_andb34:                 (andb3 true true false) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
