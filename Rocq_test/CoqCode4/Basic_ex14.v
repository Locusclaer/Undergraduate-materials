(* 实践作业14：练习用rewrite策略进行证明 *)

(** * Proof by Rewriting *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (plus_id_exercise)

    Remove "[Admitted.]" and fill in the proof.  (Note that the
    theorem has _two_ hypotheses -- [n = m] and [m = o] -- each to the
    left of an implication arrow.) *)

Theorem plus_id_exercise : forall n m o : nat,
  n = m -> m = o -> n + m = m + o.
Proof.
  intros n m o H1 H2.
  rewrite -> H1.
  rewrite -> H2.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** The [Check] command can also be used to examine the statements of
    previously declared lemmas and theorems.  The two examples below
    are lemmas about multiplication that are proved in the standard
    library.  (We will see how to prove them ourselves in the next
    chapter.) *)

Check mult_n_O.
(* ===> forall n : nat, 0 = n * 0 *)

Check mult_n_Sm.
(* ===> forall n m : nat, n * m + n = n * S m *)


(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (mult_n_1)

    Use [mult_n_Sm] and [mult_n_O] to prove the following
    theorem.  (Recall that [1] is [S O].) *)

Theorem mult_n_1 : forall p : nat,
  p * 1 = p.
Proof.
  intros p.
  rewrite <- mult_n_Sm.
  rewrite <- mult_n_O.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (identity_fn_applied_twice)

    Use the tactics you have learned so far to prove the following
    theorem about boolean functions. *)

Theorem identity_fn_applied_twice :
  forall (f : bool -> bool),
  (forall (x : bool), f x = x) ->
  forall (b : bool), f (f b) = b.
Proof.
  intros f H b.
  rewrite -> H.
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
