(** ** Binary Numerals *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (binary)

    We can generalize our unary representation of natural numbers to
    the more efficient binary representation by treating a binary
    number as a sequence of constructors [B0] and [B1] (representing 0s
    and 1s), terminated by a [Z]. For comparison, in the unary
    representation, a number is a sequence of [S] constructors terminated
    by an [O].

    For example:

        decimal               binary                          unary
           0                       Z                              O
           1                    B1 Z                            S O
           2                B0 (B1 Z)                        S (S O)
           3                B1 (B1 Z)                     S (S (S O))
           4            B0 (B0 (B1 Z))                 S (S (S (S O)))
           5            B1 (B0 (B1 Z))              S (S (S (S (S O))))
           6            B0 (B1 (B1 Z))           S (S (S (S (S (S O)))))
           7            B1 (B1 (B1 Z))        S (S (S (S (S (S (S O))))))
           8        B0 (B0 (B0 (B1 Z)))    S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S O)))))))

    Note that the low-order bit is on the left and the high-order bit
    is on the right -- the opposite of the way binary numbers are
    usually written.  This choice makes them easier to manipulate.

    (Comprehension check: What unary numeral does [B0 Z] represent?) *)

Inductive bin : Type :=
  | Z
  | B0 (n : bin)
  | B1 (n : bin).

(** Complete the definitions below of an increment function [incr]
    for binary numbers, and a function [bin_to_nat] to convert
    binary numbers to unary numbers. *)

(* 练习：完成二进制数加一函数incr、二进制数转自然数函数bin_to_nat的定义，
   并完成后面7个Example的证明。*)

Fixpoint incr (m:bin) : bin :=
  match m with
  | Z => B1 Z
  | B0 n => B1 n
  | B1 n => B0 (incr n)
  end.

Fixpoint bin_to_nat (m:bin) : nat :=
  match m with
  | Z => 0
  | B0 n => 2 * (bin_to_nat n)
  | B1 n => 2 * (bin_to_nat n) + 1
  end.

(** The following "unit tests" of your increment and binary-to-unary
    functions should pass after you have defined those functions correctly.
    Of course, unit tests don't fully demonstrate the correctness of
    your functions!  We'll return to that thought at the end of the
    next chapter. *)
